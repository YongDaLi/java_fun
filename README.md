Rediscovering Java and object-oriented programming
---

On Wednesday, October 23, 2019, I attended an IEEE x IBM workshop on microservices. It was done in Java. After spending so much time in C, Verilog, and Python, it's interesting to use some higher level language. I'm rediscovering Java, which I studied for 3 years in high school, but with a broader sense of programming. I'm using the terminal and a text editor (Sublime Text) to do some playing around in Java, instead of a protected IDE which we used in high school.
